    <h2>Python Project - Dungeons & Dragons Visual Database</h2>
    <p1>    In this project, I developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
        to display and search for spells from the popular table-top 
        roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). I retrived my data 
        from the official D&D 5th Edition API, which contains all the 
    information regarding the attributes and characteristics for any asset
    in the game, in the JSON format. 
    </p1>
    <p2>For this project, I relied on my skills in Python, but also gained
        exposure to the JSON text format, and knowledge in working with
        the Pygame library. I also appled the concepts of Object-Oriented 
        Programming extensively in the project.
