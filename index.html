            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>The Cambridge Dictionary defines an engineer as “a person whose job is to design or build [something], 
                using scientific principles.” Under this definition, I would say that while I am an engineer, I do so 
                much more. I lead and follow, I learn from others and teach others, and most importantly, I succeed 
                and fail. While I never define myself by my failures alone, I do let my failures define my roots, not 
                because of what led to those failures, but from how I rose past those failures, and took the knowledge 
                and experience that came from doing so. It is with this mentality that I reach for the stars, and is 
                the mindset I would bring along if you gave me a chance. While video game design has always been a 
                personal interest of mine, I would love to pursue it as a career, in addition to database organization, 
                cybersecurity, or other Information and Technology services.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/msrnic/Python-DnD-Visual-Database">Python Project - D&D Visual Database</a></h2>
                <p>In this project, I developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
                    to display and search for spells from the popular table-top 
                    roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). I developed buttons,
                    text format, a search bar and even an animated cursor completely from scratch. I retrieved my data 
                    from the official D&D 5th Edition API, which contains all the 
                    information regarding the attributes and characteristics for any asset
                    in the game, in the JSON format. For this project, I relied on my skills in Python, but also gained
                    exposure to the JSON text format, and knowledge in working with
                    the Pygame library. I also applied the concepts of Object-Oriented 
                    Programming in the project, with extensive use of Polymorphism and Inheritance.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/msrnic/HackEDBeta-MipsClips">HackED C++ Project - MipsClips</a></h2>
            <p>MipsClips is designed to read and interpret MIPS Assembly Code, and emulate its execution in a manner akin to real life.
                In addition to the implementation of the core MIPS instruction types, the program features the ability to modify and 
                view its own "simulated memory" system. For this project, I collaborated on a team with three of my friends in a 
                24-hour coding and design challenge that was presented to a panel of judges. This project taught me about memory 
                allocation and optimization, and avoiding memory hazards, something that is vital to both C++ and Assembly Languages. 
                It also gave me a practical experience in C++, as before this project my C++ skills felt diminished, but since the 
                completion of this project I feel much more confident in my abilities.

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/msrnic/msrnic.github.io">HTML/CSS/JS Project: Portfolio Website</a></h2>
                <p>Yes, this website was also created by me! Using the Github Pages hosting feature, I built this website completely 
                    from scratch. I incorporated the use of links and images in the HTML section, applied the stylistic choices in 
                    CSS, and created the image slideshow at the top of the webpage using Javascript. As you can see this website 
                    may seem a little... rudimentary, and that is because this website is my current ongoing project. A second 
                    version of this site is already in development, as this one project not only served as a web design teaching 
                    tool, but also as a test to see my capabilites under strict time constraints. This entire website was developed 
                    in just 48 hours, during which I not only designed and developed the website from scratch, but I also taught 
                    myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
